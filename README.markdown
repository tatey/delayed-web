# Delayed::Web for Delayed::Job

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thebestday/delayed-web.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thebestday/delayed-web)
[![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/thebestday/delayed-web.png)](https://codeclimate.com/github/thebestday/delayed-web)

A rails engine that provides a simple web interface for exposing the
[Delayed::Job](https://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job) queue.

## Requirements

* Ruby 2.2.x, 2.3.x
* Rails 3.2.x, 4.0.x, 4.1.x, 4.2.x, 5.0.x
* Delayed::Job 3.0.x, 4.0.x
* ActiveRecord or Mongoid

## Installation

Put this in your Gemfile.

    gem 'delayed-web'

Run bundler.

    bundle install

Run the installation generator.

    rails generate delayed:web:install

This will install an initializer into `config/initializers/delayed_web.rb`,
mount the engine at `/jobs` in `config/routes.rb` and add the stylesheets
to the list of precomiled assets in `application.rb` (If assets are
enabled).

## Routes

The installation script will automatically add routes into your app,
like this.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  namespace :admin do
    authenticate :spree_user do
      mount Delayed::Web::Engine, at: '/'
    end
    ....
  end
end
```

This will mount the following routes.

    GET /admin/jobs
    GET /admin/jobs/:id

## Authentication

Out of the box Delayed::Web doesn't make any assumptions about
authentication. It's possible to take advantage of rails routing
constraints or rack middleware.

An example using Devise's `authenticated` constraint.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
authenticated :spree_user, -> user { user.admin? } do
  mount Delayed::Web::Engine, at: '/'
end
```

An example using `Rack::Auth::Basic`.

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
Delayed::Web::Engine.middleware.use Rack::Auth::Basic do |username, password|
  username == ENV['USERNAME'] && password == ENV['PASSWORD']
end
```

## Backend

The installation script will automatically set the backend you're using for
`Delayed::Job`, like this.

```
# config/initializers/delayed_web.rb
Rails.application.config.to_prepare do
  Delayed::Web::Job.backend = 'active_record'
end
```

Currently supported backends are `'active_record'` and `mongoid'`. Patches
are always welcome.

## Asset Pipeline

The installation script will automatically add the engine's assets to your
application's list of precompiled assets.

```ruby
# config/application.rb
config.assets.enabled = true
config.assets.precompile << 'delayed/web/application.css'
```

This step is skipped if your project is configured not to use the asset
pipeline.

## I18n

If you want to translate flash messages, titles, sentences, ... you can set your own I18n translations to override defaults one:

```yml
en:
  delayed/web:
    views:
      id: ID
      status: Status
      created_at: Created At
      run_at: Run At
      attempts: Attempts
      last_error: Last Error
```

You can find the full list [here](https://github.com/gemsfix/delayed-web/blob/master/config/locales/en.yml).

## Developing Locally

After you've cloned the repository, run bundler.

    bundle install

Make sure the specs are passing.

    rake

Run the dummy rails app.

    cd spec/dummy
    rails s

Go to http://localhost:3000.

The dummy rails app uses `Delayed::Web::Job::Double` as its backend.
It is an in-memory double of a real Delayed::Job.
